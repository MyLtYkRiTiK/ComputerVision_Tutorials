1. There is a tutorial in folder named [ObjectDetection_TransferLearning_with_mmdetection](ObjectDetection_TransferLearning_with_mmdetection/ 
'ObjectDetection_TransferLearning_with_mmdetection').
It teaches how to use transfer learning in tasks with your own dataset using pretrained backbones and 
[mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection "mmdetection") library as an example. 

This tutorial first shows how to detect objects from the MS-COCO classes, such as a cat, a person, a car, or kitchen utensils. 
And then the free labeled data of four classes is used to train the model to distinguish otters, squirrels, pandas and raccoons.
